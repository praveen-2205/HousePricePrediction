# House Price Prediction- a Data Science and Machine Learning project
## About This Project
#### In this project I have made a website which calculates the price of land in Bengaluru based on the location, area (in square feet), number of BHK and bathroom. It involves the concept of Data Cleaning, Data Visualisation, Outlier Detection, Outlier removal, One Hot Encoding, Feature Engineering, Dimensionality Reduction, Grid SearchCV.
#### After all these process, I divided the dataset for Training and Testing the model. I did this for all three model such as Linear Regression, Lasso (L1 Regularisation), Desicion Tree Regressor and found the best suitable model.
#### I exported my model as a pickle file and I created a website using HTML, CSS, Javascript for front
